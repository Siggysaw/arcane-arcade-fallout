## Releasing

### Release candidate

As a maintainer, when you would like to release a test version of the system.
Go to the [releases page of github](https://github.com/Siggysaw/arcane-arcade-fallout/releases/new).
Click choose a take and git it a unique Id. eg: `v0.5.0.rc1`.
Title and description are optional.
Select checkbox "Set as a pre-release"
Click "Publish release"
This will trigger a github action that will package the system into a zip file.
After a couple minutes a release will be post to the [releases page](https://github.com/Siggysaw/arcane-arcade-fallout/releases).
Copy the link to the `system.json` file and install it via that link wherever you are running foundry.
